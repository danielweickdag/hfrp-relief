## Issue: Gallery images not displaying

### Quick Debug Steps:

1. **Check Console Errors:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Navigate to /gallery
   - Look for any error messages

2. **Test Direct Image Access:**
   - Try accessing: http://localhost:3000/gallery/IMG-20250413-WA0001.jpg
   - Should show the image directly

3. **Check Loading States:**
   - Images may be stuck in loading state
   - Look for loading spinners that never disappear
