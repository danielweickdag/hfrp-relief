- All admin functionality is protected by permission checks
- The system is fully responsive and works on mobile devices
- Settings are stored in localStorage for persistence between sessions
- Analytics events are tracked for admin actions
- Blog system includes full CRUD operations with draft saving and scheduling

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- Password handling uses a more secure approach in a production environment
- API keys are managed through environment variables for security
- All sensitive operations require confirmation
- User actions are logged for audit purposes
