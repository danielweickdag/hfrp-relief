# Manual DNS Setup for familyreliefproject7.org

Since the API is having authentication issues, here's how to manually configure your DNS records:

## Step 1: Access Cloudflare Dashboard
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Log in to your account
3. Click on `familyreliefproject7.org` domain

## Step 2: Configure DNS Records
Go to **DNS > Records** and add these A records:

### Record 1: Apex Domain
- **Type:** A
- **Name:** @ (or leave blank for root domain)
- **IPv4 address:** 76.76.21.21
- **TTL:** Auto (or 1 minute for faster testing)
- **Proxy status:** üü† Proxied (recommended) or ‚òÅÔ∏è DNS only

### Record 2: WWW Subdomain
- **Type:** A
- **Name:** www
- **IPv4 address:** 76.76.21.21
- **TTL:** Auto (or 1 minute for faster testing)
- **Proxy status:** üü† Proxied (recommended) or ‚òÅÔ∏è DNS only

## Step 3: Verify Configuration
After adding the records, you should see:
```
@ (familyreliefproject7.org) ‚Üí 76.76.21.21
www (www.familyreliefproject7.org) ‚Üí 76.76.21.21
```

## Step 4: Test DNS Propagation
Wait 5-10 minutes, then test:

### Using Command Line:
```bash
dig familyreliefproject7.org
dig www.familyreliefproject7.org
```

### Using Online Tools:
- https://dnschecker.org
- https://whatsmydns.net

## Step 5: Test Website Access
Once DNS propagates, test these URLs:
- https://familyreliefproject7.org
- https://www.familyreliefproject7.org

## Expected Timeline:
- **DNS Propagation:** 5-10 minutes
- **SSL Certificate:** 10-15 minutes after DNS
- **Full Accessibility:** 15-30 minutes total

## Troubleshooting:
If the website doesn't load:
1. Check DNS propagation with online tools
2. Verify Vercel domain configuration: `vercel domains ls`
3. Check SSL certificate status in Cloudflare
4. Try accessing via HTTP first: http://familyreliefproject7.org

## Alternative: Use familyreliefproject.org
If you prefer to use the existing `familyreliefproject.org` domain:
1. Update Vercel to use `familyreliefproject.org`
2. Configure the same DNS records for that domain
3. This domain is already active in Cloudflare
