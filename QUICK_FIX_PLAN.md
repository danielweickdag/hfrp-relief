# ðŸš€ QUICK DEPLOYMENT FIX

## Issue Identified

Module resolution problems in Vercel cloud build environment. Files exist locally but can't be resolved in production build.

## Quick Solution

Let me temporarily disable the problematic admin components so we can get your main site deployed with live Stripe functionality.

## Files to Temporarily Disable

- BlogStatsDashboard
- ContactForm (advanced features)
- DonationDashboard (admin)
- StripeConfig (admin)
- VolunteerDashboard (admin)

## Core Features That Will Work

âœ… **Main donation system** (most important)
âœ… **Live Stripe payments**
âœ… **Webhook endpoint**
âœ… **Campaign pages**
âœ… **Basic contact form**
âœ… **All public pages**

## Plan

1. **Temporarily comment out** the problematic imports
2. **Deploy successfully** to get your domain working
3. **Set up Stripe webhook** with live domain
4. **Fix admin components** after main site is live

This way you'll have a working donation system while we resolve the admin dashboard issues.

Should I proceed with this approach? Your main donation functionality will be 100% operational.
